# WEEK 1 SYSTEM PLANNING AND INITIAL SETUP
## Introduction
The aim of Week 1 is to design the overall architecture for the proposed system, choose an operating system for the development platform, and conduct an initial survey of the system resources by using Linux command-line utilities.
## System Architecture design
### Architecture overview
The system is made up of two machines:

--> Workstation – It is a computer that is used by the administrator to control the server from a remote location.

--> Server - This is a headless Linux server that can only be accessed through SSH.

This design is more secure and is modeled after real-world server administration practices.
